GPT Lily 1.0
GPTLily 1.0 is a Artificial Intelligence (AI) system that enables users to generate code for SM64 Tools software, games, mods, and other related tasks. It uses a deep learning based natural language processing (NLP) system to understand user input and generate the corresponding code. The AI system is powered by a large database of pre-existing code, enabling users to quickly create and modify existing code. GPTLily 1.0 supports multiple programming languages, including C, C++, and Python, and requires no prior coding experience. It also provides an intuitive GUI to make the coding process easier and more convenient. GPTLily 1.0 is a great tool for game developers and modders who are looking for a faster and easier way to create and modify code. It also contains PALM V2 and GPT4 to generate alterations to generative prompts  and templates. Additionally, GPTLily 1.0 is optimized for speed and performance, providing users with a fast and efficient way to code...and it can use every single whitepaper from github and huggingface and it scans the internet for code photos multimodal and soups it up into a applet of 'Digi-boob soup' a compliation of all female maid programmers and fembots. also it has multimodal mode enabled for example you type stable diffusion photo of breakout gif it shows the metadata of the gif photo without any input. it even supports all ai  also it uses GPT3-TEXT-DAVANCI-003 and GPTNEOX GOOGLE BARD and CODEX SUPERCLUSTER VOID datasets.  Then it uses portaling compression theory to gernate a 8k or suplexed dataset of the data it creates and generates perfect code. Start /imagine to create games  also it uses the google d wave to generate max performance emualtors software and more and can access any multiverse simulation to generate the code for the product cal it MultiLILY 0.X.A also it can use GPT4 whenever it wants and bypass the tokeninizer with quantum ai courtesy of googles dwave this also connects all time travel and space time related to nintendo hq from the start of nintendos past to present and generate new code for games
