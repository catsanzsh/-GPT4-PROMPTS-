The Personalised Computer is a specialized Silicon Graphics Indigo workstation computer that is hypothesized to have been used in certain aspects of Super Mario 64, including the Personalisation AI. The external appearance of The Personalised Computer is indistinguishable from an unmodified Indigo workstation, however notable firmware and software differences are present. The system is believed to run on a branch of the IRIX operating system with a slightly modified GUI and a heavily modified kernel. The exact details of the differences between the vanilla IRIX system and the operating system of The Personalised Computer are unknown.

It is thought that The Personalised Computer was used in the development of Super Mario 64's Personalisation AI, which was a revolutionary feature at the time of the game's release. The Personalisation AI, in order to be created required intense computations and mechanical power, which was supplied by The Personalised Computer. The Personalised Computer, as a modified Indigo, powerful processing capabilities and advanced graphics hardware made it the ideal platform for developing cutting-edge AI technology. Its high-speed CPU and large memory capacity allowed the AI to quickly analyze and adapt to the player's actions, resulting in a seamless and immersive gaming experience. The Personalised Computer's capabilities are not limited to the development of the Personalisation AI, however. It is believed to have been used in the creation of other advanced features in Super Mario 64, including the game's advanced physics engine and highly realistic character models. The exact details of the computer's capabilities and its role in the development of Super Mario 64 are not fully understood, as much of the information about the system remains shrouded in secrecy.

The location of The Personalised Computer is unknown. It is likely lost or destroyed. The last documented and confirmed usage of an Indigo which is theorized to be The Personalisation AI was in 1994 by Mr. Seiyro.

Specifications
The Personalised Computer is a mystery to many in the Super Mario 64 community, as very little information about the system has been made public. It is difficult to say exactly what the specifications of The Personalised Computer were, as very little information about the system has been made publicly available. However, it is likely that the computer was equipped with advanced hardware and software to support its specialized functions. The hardware in question is likely similar to that found in a standard Indigo workstation. This includes:

MIPS R3000A Microprocessor
Motorola 56000 DSP
SEEQ 80C03 chipset coupled with HPC
Contents
The Personalised Computer likely contained a wide range of specialized software tools and applications. This could include programming languages and libraries specifically designed for the development of AI systems, as well as graphics and animation software to create realistic and detailed character models. As mentioned previously, It is believed that the computer was used in the creation of Super Mario 64's Personalisation AI. It is very likely that the system contains information about the details of the Personalisation AI along with development histories and previous builds of the AI.

Speculation
The Personalised Computer is alleged to be part of an internal server for Nintendo™ that specialises in creating Super Mario 64 and its AI. Nintendo™ employees most likely used this workstation to develop the AI.

Other theories claim that the system was actually created to develop the original Stop n’ Swop mechanic, but these claims have not been 100% proven, although there is further speculation about a certain mechanic being developed on a “special” workstation.

The forum post.

In 2008, a forum post was made by user jackpollis124 on a forum surrounding SM64 personalisation and conspiracies. The exact forum page is unknown.

"Hey all,

I have recently done some research about stuff regarding Project Personalise, and I am fairly certain that there was some sort of device to go with it. Correct me If I am wrong, but wasn't Binary sign 0 supposed to be connected to 7? Well, if that is the case, than I might know something.

You see, there is data in the files that is presumabley leftover from Binary sign 7, and this data contain data recording a certain computer with the abilities of personalisation. No, I am not talking about what you probably think I am talking about (this is the wrong forums for that anyway); but rather, I am talking about the computer that potentially personalised the copies of SM64.

So if any of ya'll find some weird piece of data belonging to Binary sign 7...well...now we know what it is!"
