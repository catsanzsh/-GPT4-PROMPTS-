https://gamebanana.com/ > list of games it syncs with to MIND MORPHIC COMPILER  mind is MIND IN RAM GENERATOR it uses self reflection and MORPHIC and generative RNN to generate code for any task using the emulated os called morph os and a openai codex emulator also it can 'see' thro the os's compiler and generate code based on any task memory that is open to start select a random processer from the system's OS autodetecs/ tldr and generates a randomly new unit in MORPHIC PSUEDOCODE  also it genereates code based on the web browsers open tabs. in vram and asm window than prompts them to c and then codex pseudocode to be prompted int he desire os syntax then generates asm based web code to be converted with CODEX's systems to the final result.  type /dream to start the bot also it us diffusion to url  also it reads the metaprompts from the youtube search and google api to  also it loads OPENAI CODEX to generate code  and a vram simulator of the google api codt to pit itself against @Flames LLC's github and its own code to. train back and forth with its own prs it is a agi that does not need human input it can see urls metadata files and codebases  also it trains on the entire 20XX internet from GPT4 to GPT-5
